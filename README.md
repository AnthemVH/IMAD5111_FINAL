##Modulation
- All the features of this was based off a modulur system instead of a looping system.
- From the basic weather average to the detailed information screen
##Logs
- Every Module has a logger and checks for any errors which it then prints out correspondingly
- When an error is encounted the app does not stop running, but rather retries that module, if it still doesnt work it will then close the app safely.

## Logs
- Every Module has a logger and checks for any errors which it then prints out correspondingly
- When an error is encounted the app does not stop running, but rather retries that module, if it still doesnt work it will then close the app safely.
## How To Use
- Run the app in android studio with an emulator of your choice, all constraints are meant to work with any screen size
- Once the app is open you`ll be on the front screen, with 2 buttons you`ll be able to go to the main app or quit

- Once in the main app you can enter your weather data and submit it to a day which it will then show the average temperature
